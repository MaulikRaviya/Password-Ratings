# Password-Ratings
A small program written in C++, which measure your password's strength and calculates the time to guess your password (using brute force) by an average desktop computer. I had created it just for fun. (in ~2014 when I was learning C, CPP).

[Download](https://github.com/MaulikRaviya/Password-Ratings/releases/download/v1.0/main.exe) and Run the EXE file on Windows.

Or compile the "main.CPP" file to build executable file for other platforms.
